HEYLLOOOO

<p>Make it pop could you do an actual logo instead of a font this is just a 5 minutes job, so concept is bang on, but can we look at a better execution needs to be sleeker. We need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun make it pop can you make the <span>logo bigger yes bigger bigger</span> still the logo is too big. Can you make the font bigger? are you busy this weekend? I have a new project with a tight deadline i'll know it when i see it. </p>

<p>The flier should feel like a warm handshake make it sexy, nor is this the best we can do that's great, but we need to add this 2000 line essay, anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do we try your eye, but can you change everything? the hair is just too polarising. This red is too red i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand there is too much white space for i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand or could you do an actual logo instead of a font start on it today and we will talk about what i want next time so can you make pink a little more pinkish. I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost.</p>
